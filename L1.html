        <h1>MY First Web Page</h1>
        <h3>Heading Are Great Fun</h3>
        <p>This is my first <b>paragraph</b> in my new <i>webpage</i>. This is going to be <br>great. I am so excited I can hardly contain
            <b>myself</b>. Don't you just love <br>paragraphs? I find them very useful.</p>
        <h3>Web Pages Are Exciting Too</h3>
        <p>Yes, that's right - web pages can be a lot of fun. Learning how to create<br> web pages is easy and <b>entertaining</b>.
            This is my second <i>paragraph</i>. I<br> hope you like it.</p>
